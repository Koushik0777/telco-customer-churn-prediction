# Telco Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, leading to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.
The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

## Dataset
Publicly available Telco Customer Churn dataset containing customer demographics, service usage, and billing information.
The dataset represents real-world customer behavior in the telecommunications domain.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and categorical encoding
- Exploratory data analysis to understand churn patterns
- Machine learning models for churn prediction
- Model evaluation using classification metrics

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

Special attention is given to **recall**, as missing a churn-prone customer can result in business loss.

## Key Insights
- Certain customer segments have higher churn probability
- Contract type and service usage strongly influence churn
- Class imbalance affects model performance and must be handled carefully
- Predictive models can support customer retention strategies

## Limitations
- Customer behavior may change over time
- External factors such as pricing changes and promotions are not included
- Not suitable for production use without continuous retraining and validation

## Disclaimer
This project is developed for **educational purposes only** and is not intended for real-world business deployment.
